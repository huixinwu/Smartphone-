      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>The theme of the activity is Sweet Dreams. In this activity, students will create animation to three elements: twinkling stars (at least 6 stars), a flying witch in a broom, and a flowing message. </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>The twinkling stars</b> should have a flashing effect, each star should flashes at a different speed, and should have a different position and size. There are different ways to create this effect; one way to do so is by changing the opacity of the element. </li>
        <li><b>The flying witch in a broom</b> should appears on the left, goes up to the sky (with a zoom in effect), and goes down (with a zoom out effect). Each time the witch changes the position, the opacity and size of the witch changes too. For example, when the witch flies in, it should appear in a very small size and low opacity and it should fly up. Once the witch flies up the sky, the size should change to a bigger size and showing a clear image of the witch. When the witch flies down, it should appear in a very small size and low opacity again. To create those effects is by changing the opacity, position (top, left, bottom, or right), and scale of the element.</li>
        <li><b>Flowing message. </b>The last element is a flowing message that appears after the witch flies out the screen. The message should enter from the right, stop for a second in the center of the screen, flow all the way to the left, and then come back to the center. Each time the message changes the position, it should changes the font color, the text shadowâ€™s color, and the font-size. </li>
      </ol>
