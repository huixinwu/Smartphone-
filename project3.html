    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><br>
      Project 3 will be to create an app for children between 3 and 6 years old. The app will focus on teaching children
      users to develop their speech through graphics. For example, you can create an app where children can learn
      numbers, colors, simple words, places, animals, etc., in English and/or another language. The application must
      have the following parameters:
    <ul>
      <li>The user has the opportunity to choose between two different learning skills. For example, to learn numbers
        and colors, or to learn a new language and different animals.</li>
      <li>When the user chooses the learning skill, the topic has to have 10 selections. For example, if the user
        chooses to learn number, the user can see a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and when the user clicks on a number,
        it will show a photo of each number, how to pronounce it, and how the numbers are written in English and/or
        another language.</li>
      <li>Also, you should use a primary color with its darkest and lightest color, or apply a secondary color. Remember
        that white, black, and gray are complementary colors and do not count as primary or secondary colors. The colors
        applied in project 3 should be primary and/or secondary colors, and some complementary colors. Other colors are
        not allowed in the App.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <!-- GRADING TABLE -->
    <p>To complete the App for kids requires the application and manipulation of the HTML and CSS skills learned in
      class. All elements in the App must work properly. The requirements and grading for project 3 are:

    <section class="videoSection">
      <p>You can see the work of some students in the videos below. The previous students' work will help you to have an idea about the components or elements that the project 3 must have. You can use the video as a reference; however, your app's layout and design doesn't have to be the same as the video's; instead, project 3 app should have the items listed in the table above.</p>
