      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p><br>
        Project 3 will be to create an app for children between 3 and 6 years old. The app will focus on teaching children users to develop their speech through graphics. For example, you can create an app where children can learn numbers, colors, simple words, places, animals, etc., in English and/or another language. The application must have the following parameters:
       <ul>
         <li>The user has the opportunity to choose between two different learning skills. For example, to learn numbers and colors, or to learn a new language and different animals.</li>
         <li>When the user chooses the learning skill, the topic has to have 10 selections. For example, if the user chooses to learn number, the user can see a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and when the user clicks on a number, it will show a photo of each number, how to pronounce it, and how the numbers are written in English and/or another language.</li>
         <li>Also, you should use a primary color with its darkest and lightest color, or apply a secondary color. Remember that white, black, and gray are complementary colors and do not count as primary or secondary colors. The colors applied in project 3 should be primary and/or secondary colors, and some complementary colors. Other colors are not allowed in the App.</li> 
       </ul>
