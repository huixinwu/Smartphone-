    <!-- DESCRIPTION-->
    <div class="activityP">
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p><br>
        Project 2 consists of creating a sales page. The purpose of project 2 is to use the knowledge of colors, image manipulation, animation, modal window, and slideshow to create a simple sales app.
     </p> <br>
     <h3>Procedure</h3>
     <ol>
      <li>Prepare your development environment for project 2. In the text-editor, make sure you have an index.html and a style.css file. Also create a new folder for images. </li>
      <li>Create a header, with a logo and title, to the top of the app.</li>
      <li>Create one slideshow with five slides, delay between slides, and backward to the beginning of the slides. The slideshow could be only text, images, or text and images. </li>
      <li>One introduction image with filter and a text message in front of the image. The text message should have border, border-radius, title, text with different colors, and two internal hyperlinks link to two different sections in the app. </li>
      <li>Present at least four products. Each product should have an image with a text message in front of it, information paragraph, price, and a hyperlink. The hyperlink will open a modal window. </li>
      <li>Each modal window should have a box-shadow, title, close symbol “X”, an image, a description paragraph, a footer section with ADD TO CART link. When the modal window is closed, it should go back to its respective product. For example, if you open the modal window for product 3, when you close the modal window of product 3, the app should go to product 3. The other three product should have the same style as the first product. </li>
      <li>The last section of project 2 is Contact Us. The contact us section should have an email icon linked to an email, and a phone icon with a phone number. Also, within the Contact Us section, it should have three social media icons. Each icon should be linked to its respective URL in a new window. </li>
      <li>Add a footer to the end of the app. The footer of the app should have the following credential: <em>Designed by________ (student’s name) @ 2023
        The information and material used is for educational purpose and not commercial purpose
        </em></li>
     </ol>
