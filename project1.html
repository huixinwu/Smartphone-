      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p><br>
      	Project 1 consists of creating a one-page informative app. The topic is free to choose, you can talk about places, concepts, nature, beauty, cars, etc..., where you want to inform people about it. This information must have four sections: introduction, information 1, information 2, and contact. For example, if you picked Japan as your topic, then you want to provide the following information to the user: 
      	<ol>
      			<li>Introduction: where is the place and why it is a famous place.</li>
      			<li>Information 1: Activities to do in that place.</li>
      			<li>Information 2: Important things or locations of that place.</li>
      			<li>Contact: contact information</li>
      	</ol>
        <br>
      	Remember that you are creating a one page web app using the HTML skills learned in Week/Day 1, 2, 3, and 4 of class. The HMTL skills that must be in your websites are:
      	<ul>
      			<li>Writing links: linking to other sites, to an email address, and to a specific part of the same page </li>
      			<li>Text characteristics, text-size, text alignment, text shadow, text border, margin and padding </li>
      			<li>Design layout in CSS using flex element (properties), and box-sizing. You can also use float properties instead of flex properties.</li>
      			<li>CSS styling images: rounded, circled, border, and shadow images. </li>
      			<li>Navigation Bars (fixed navigation bar). </li>
            <li>Create contact and media icons. </li>
      		</ul>
  		 <br>
      </p>

      <h3>Project 1 template video</h3>
      <p>You can watch the video below to get an idea about the components or items that project 1 needs to have. You can use the video as a reference, however, your app design does not necessarily have to be the sample as the one in the video, but it does have to have the items listed in the table above.</p>
