        <dd>
          This OER material is intended for use as the first level of web app development.
          It introduces the use and features of smartphones in modern life and how to create working applications. Students will create apps using existing modules and building blocks. No prior programming knowledge is necessary. After this initial experience, basics of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming language will be introduced along with a minimum of XML programming to introduce the student to the needs of more advanced apps. Software development kits (SDK), along with the development environment will also be covered. In addition, students will have the opportunity to distribute apps into the Marketplace.

     <p><b>Description</b><br><br>
	     Project 3 will be to create an app for children between 3 and 6 years old. The app will focus on teaching children users to develop their speech through graphics. For example, you can create an app where children can learn numbers, colors, simple words, places, animals, etc., in English and/or another language. The application must have the following parameters:
      	<ul>
      		<li>The child has the opportunity to choose between two topics, for example, one to learn numbers and another to learn colors, or one to learn a new language and different animals.</li>
      		<li>When the child chooses the topic, the topic has to have 10 selections, for example, if the child chose to learn number, the child can see a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and when the child clicks on a number, it will show a photo of each number, how to pronounce it, and how the numbers are written in English and/or another language.</li>
      	</ul>
